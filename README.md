# Mantle

Mantle runs a whole development session (Claude Code, its workspace and toolchain) on a remote
Linux worker, confined by [Substrate](https://github.com/beyond10x/substrate). The laptop renders
the terminal; builds use the worker's CPU.

```console
mantle worker up                 # one EC2 worker, reachable only through AWS SSM
mantle start examples/substrate.yaml
mantle attach substrate-work     # Ctrl-b d detaches; the agent keeps running
mantle status substrate-work
mantle stop substrate-work
mantle worker down
```

Status: first vertical slice, under construction. The design is
[docs/design/00-mantle-on-substrate.md](docs/design/00-mantle-on-substrate.md); its correction block
lists what the slice does differently from the design and why.

## Requirements on the laptop

- Linux, Rust 1.97 (`rust-toolchain.toml`), [go-task](https://taskfile.dev)
- AWS CLI v2 with an SSO profile that may create EC2, IAM and CloudWatch resources, and
  `session-manager-plugin`
- `ssh`
- a Claude Code OAuth token from `claude setup-token`

Copy [examples/config.toml](examples/config.toml) to `~/.config/mantle/config.toml` and fill it in.
